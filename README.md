Introduction :
This project leverages SVM, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to detect potential instances of insurance fraud based on historical claims data. SVM is chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and find optimal hyperplanes for binary classification tasks.

Features :
Utilizes SVM for binary classification of insurance claims.
Easily customizable for different datasets and insurance domains.
Provides an efficient and accurate fraud detection solution.
Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration and model training)

Usage

Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and contains relevant features for fraud detection.

Train the SVM model: Use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the SVM model on your dataset.

Evaluate the model: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.

Integrate with your application: Once satisfied with the model's performance, integrate it into your insurance claims processing system for real-time fraud detection.

Data :
The dataset used for training and testing the model is located in the data directory. Please refer to the data documentation for details on the features and labels.

Model Training :
Explore the model_training.ipynb Jupyter Notebook for a step-by-step guide on training the SVM model. Adjust hyperparameters as needed for optimal performance on your specific dataset.

Evaluation :
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation.ipynb notebook provides examples of how to perform model evaluation.

Results :
Include any notable results, insights, or visualizations obtained from the model training and evaluation process.
